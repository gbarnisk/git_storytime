I'd like to 4Git Chapter 4.
By Griffin Barniskis.

As the four friends reconvened, the feeling of dread was palpable.
They began to realize they had created a monster.
They had edited the same files, and in the same places!
There were only two options: Merge, or die.
Friend three opened up his suit, and revealed he was actually the Batman!

It was not enough.

The funerals were quite sad.
